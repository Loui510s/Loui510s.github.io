    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p class="medium">Hi, I'm Louie Olsen born in 2005, been doing photography for since 2013 when my dad gave me his old camera to teach me his hobby. 
        I am a passionate photographer with a love for nature and the outdoors. I enjoy capturing the beauty of the world around us, 
        from stunning landscapes to intricate details of wildlife. This website is made entirely by me to showcase my work and share my passion with others and you can find the
        link to my  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/louie.flo05/">Instagram</a>. and to my  <a href="https://github.com/Loui510s">GitHub</a>. for business inquiries 
        please contact me via my <a href="mailto:Louie.ferdinand05@gmail.com">email</a>. and my profile on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/louie-olsen-5785992a3/">linkedin</a>.
        . as a photographer, I am always looking for new opportunities and collaborations. I have experience in event photography, landscape shoots,
        wildlife photography, and more. although I do not have any portrait photographs on my page, I do have experience in that field as well as I have been a camera man for a
        photobooth during a few events. though I do not have any professional training, I am constantly learning and improving my skills through practice, experimentation and
        open to expanding my portfolio.<br> in my every day life, I study at DTU in Denmark, where I am pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer engineering, and a master's 
        degree in electrical engineering. I am passionate about technology and innovation, and I believe that my background in engineering complements my work as a 
        photographer by providing me with a unique perspective on the technical aspects of photography. other than being a student I also do volunteer work at UNF Denmark, 
        where I help organize events and activities for young people interested in science and technology. so far my volunteer work as included being a photographer at some of 
        the summer camps organized by UNF Denmark. <br> overall, I am a dedicated and enthusiastic photographer with a love for capturing the beauty of the world around us. 
        I am always looking for new opportunities to grow and expand my skills, and I am excited to see where my passion for photography will take me in the future.
        on my GitHub, you can find some of my coding projects as I am also a hobbyist programmer.
